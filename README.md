# Lab 7: Rolling Dice

Today you are practicing writing two functions to play a simple dice-based game. Follow along in the instructions to write out both functions.

I was able to write some simple tests here to check the output of your function, despite their random nature (setting the _seed_ makes this possible). Really, this is a problem that you should be able to check easily just with some print statements, but this way you'll still get that happy green check if all goes well.
